# Datovn

Datovn (pronounced "date-oven") is a computation engine designed for complex data transformations, particularly in game development and other domains. It provides a runtime environment to define and execute interdependent data transformation steps as pipelines.

Datovn employs a specification-based approach to define pipelines, enabling integration with existing tools, compilers, and editors. Inspired by experiences in game data baking, Datovn introduces the concept of "Computation Action" to skip up-to-date computations, significantly speeding up the process.

Datovn is CI-friendly, making it easy to integrate into continuous integration systems for automated testing and deployment.
